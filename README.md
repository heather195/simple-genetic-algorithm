Computational Intelligence Module 2 - Evolutionary Algorithms

This is an implementation of a simple genetic algorithm, coded in Python, which includes the following genetic algorithm components:
- Fitness function
- Population of individuals
- Reproduction
- Mutation
- Crossover

In this example, given a population of 8 12-bit individuals encoded with zeros and ones, we wish to evolve a child that fits the following pattern: 010010010010.

Improvements are still to be made to this algorithm to make it more flexible in terms of input, fit child, and stopping functions for the evolution

Also included is a simple hill climbing algorithm which attempts for find the optimal solution for a given mathematical equation. More about hill climbing can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-hill-climbing-artificial-intelligence/).
